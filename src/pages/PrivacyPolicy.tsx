          <p>
            A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your
            computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the
            cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a
            particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as
            an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your
            needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information
            about your preferences.

          <p>
            We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used.
            This helps us analyze data about webpage traffic and improve our
            website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this
            information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is
            removed from the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by
            enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do
            not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any

            automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
            browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent
